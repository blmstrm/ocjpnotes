Using this book:

Different classes containing code with concepts that needed repetition on my side.

The class ExamReadiness.java takes mostly all objectives from the Exam Readiness Checklist on page xxxviii and translates them into working code.
The purpose of this class was to implement it without looking through any book or api documentation.
